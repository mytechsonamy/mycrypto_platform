## Key Test Insights

### Story 2.4 (Crypto Deposit)
**Focus Areas:**
- Blockchain integration (BlockCypher webhook)
- Address uniqueness and validation
- Balance atomicity and consistency
- Network mismatch prevention (USDT)
- Confirmation tracking (3 for BTC, 12 for ETH)

**Critical Risks:**
1. Address theft (CVSS 9.8)
2. Balance corruption (CVSS 9.5)
3. Network mismatch (CVSS 9.2)

**Mitigation:** HD Wallet, atomic transactions, network-specific addresses

---

### Story 2.5 (Crypto Withdrawal)
**Focus Areas:**
- Address whitelisting (reduces email confirmation)
- 2FA enforcement
- Admin approval for large withdrawals (>$10K)
- Fee calculation (dynamic network + flat platform)
- Status progression (Pending → Broadcasting → Confirmed)

**Key Challenges:**
- Multi-signature cold wallet validation
- Concurrent withdrawal handling
- Fee accuracy under network conditions

---

### Story 1.5 (KYC Submission)
**Focus Areas:**
- Document upload & virus scanning
- MKS API integration (Turkish ID verification)
- Manual review queue
- GDPR/KVKK compliance
- File encryption at rest (S3)

**Risk Areas:**
- Personal data protection (PII)
- Document authentication
- Fraud detection

---

## Recommendations for Tech Lead Review

### Priority Actions
1. **Immediate:** Review Story 2.4 test plan and risk assessment
2. **High:** Approve security controls (CVSS scoring)
3. **High:** Validate acceptance criteria mapping
4. **Medium:** Review automated test collection
5. **Follow-up:** Provide feedback on Stories 2.5 & 1.5 approach

### Questions for Clarification
1. Are confirmation counts (3 BTC, 12 ETH) correct?
2. Should 2FA be required for all withdrawals or only >$1000?
3. Admin approval threshold: is $10,000 correct?
4. Cold wallet signing: completely admin-only or user-initiated?
5. Rate limiting: 5 address generations per hour - correct?

### Escalations
- BlockCypher webhook reliability (external dependency)
- Network fee calculation accuracy (blockchain variable)
- Cold wallet infrastructure readiness
